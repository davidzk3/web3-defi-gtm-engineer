# Web3 / DeFi GTM Engineer Sheet



A practical, Web3-native GTM framework for protocol growth, ecosystem expansion, and onchain user activation.



This repository reframes traditional GTM engineering around **wallet behavior, onchain signals, incentives, and governance**, rather than CRM-first sales motions.


---



## What This Is



A **Go-To-Market operating system** for Web3:



- Signal-driven, not lead-driven  

- Wallet-centric, not account-centric  

- Incentive-aware, not funnel-only  

- Onchain-first, not CRM-first  



This is how modern Web3 growth actually works.

## 1. Strategy & Plays (Web3 Native)



### Warm



**Relationship-based**

- Founders and teams previously supported

- DAO contributors and ecosystem operators

- Builders met via hackathons or grants

- Strategic partners (wallets, infra, L2s)



**History-based**

- Wallets that interacted with v1

- Testnet users

- Grant recipients

- Prior governance participants



**Social engagement**

- Discord contributors

- Telegram power users

- X followers engaging with protocol content

- GitHub contributors and stargazers



---



### Signal-Based (Core Web3 GTM Layer)



**Onchain signals**

- First interaction timestamp

- Transaction frequency

- Contract interaction types

- Fees generated

- TVL contribution

- Staking or LP behavior

- Governance voting activity



**Wallet behavior signals**

- Swap-only users

- LP-only users

- Swap + LP users

- Whale vs retail clustering

- Multichain activity patterns



**Ecosystem signals**

- Bridging from competitor chains

- Usage of competing protocols

- Post-incentive retention

- Airdrop farming patterns



**Developer signals**

- Contract deployments

- Testnet usage

- SDK adoption

- RPC call volume

- GitHub commits

### Cold (ICP Fit for Web3)



**ICP dimensions**

- Chain or ecosystem

- User type (retail, DAO, fund, MM)

- Use case (DeFi, infra, RWA, gaming)

- Capital size (wallet balance, TVL)

- Activity level (DAU, tx frequency)



---



## 2. Data Aggregation (Web3 Stack)



### First-party

- Smart contract events

- Subgraphs and indexers

- App-level analytics

- Wallet connection data



### Second-party

- Partner protocol usage

- Ecosystem grants data

- L2 dashboards

- Hackathon participation



### Third-party

- Dune Analytics

- DefiLlama

- Token price feeds

- Funding announcements

- Governance forums



### Social and offchain

- X engagement

- Discord activity

- Telegram messages

- GitHub activity

- Blog and forum posts



---



## 3. Data Enrichment (GTM Intelligence Layer)



**Normalize**

- Wallet clustering

- Cross-chain identity resolution

- Contract labeling

- User segmentation



**Score**

- Activation likelihood

- Retention probability

- Whale probability

- Developer quality

- Governance influence



**Segment**

- Power users

- Long-term holders

- Liquidity farmers

- Mercenary capital

- Builders



**AI augmentation**

- Wallet behavior summarization

- Governance sentiment analysis

- Proposal outcome prediction

- Personalized GTM messaging

## 4. Data Activation (Execution)



### Outbound (Protocol-Led)

- DAO outreach

- Builder grants

- Strategic integrations

- Market maker onboarding

- Ecosystem BD



### Inbound

- Content-led growth

- Developer documentation

- Transparency dashboards

- Airdrops with behavioral filters



### RevOps (Web3 Version)

- Grant pipeline tracking

- Partner lifecycle management

- Integration status tracking

- Incentive ROI measurement

- DAO proposal tracking



### Growth Loops

- Incentives → volume → fees → buy pressure

- Developers → apps → users → protocol revenue

- Governance → alignment → retention



---
